When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you collaborate with others or need to have access to you work from multiple locations.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to
date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes allows you to put the changes that you approve locally rather than accepting all changes
 Describe the differences between forks, clones,and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 A fork occurs on github and allows a respotory to be worked in different repositores while still giving credit to the originator. A clone copies a repository to a different location. A branch allows 
 different changes to occur to the program in the same repository. A branch is for when you need 2 versions of the program. A fork is for multiple users and clones can be for different users and locations.
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 If you are collaborating then you can easily see the differences or return to them because they are
 local.
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 I could email or post files to a joint site. It would be harder to compare files and track how many
 changes occured. It might be easier to in the sense there would be no commands to learn.
 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each have?
 I would want to make changes in a separate branch when I did 2 different copies as I made changes or 
 the changes logically followed more on the branch than master. If it is a change that will definitely be needed master can be updated. the benefits of updating the master is that collabarators will easily
 see changes. With a branch a separate change is available until ready to incorporate.
